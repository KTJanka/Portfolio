                    World of Warcraft is a game designed by Activision Blizzard, Inc. The history of Blizzard started in Febuary of 1991
                    when Allen Adham, Frank Pearce and Mike Morhaime started the company Silicon & Synapse.
                    Most of their early works included projects that were simple port games like battle chess and
                    Lord of the Rings for the Amiga. In 1992 the company release RPM racing for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System,
                    the next year they released The Lost Vikings for the SNES which became quite a fan favorite. In 1994
                    the company changed their name to Blizzard, they also began work on a new project that would be quite 
                    significant for their future! Later that year Warcraft: Orcs vs Humans was released and Blizzard officially 
                    entered the world of PC gaming. At the end of 1995 a follow-up was released called Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness beating
                    out the competition that was trying desperately to follow in their success. Warcraft 2 became an award winning game by 1996!
                    In 1996 Blizzard created the game Diablo which became a huge success with millions of fans! With the success of
                    Warcraft they also decided to try out a space theme version and Starcraft was born. Starcraft became the most successful game
                    of 1998, with over 1.8 million copies sold worldwide. In 1999 Warcraft 3 was annouced as the first roleplaying real time strategy
                    game. In 2004 Blizzard's biggest hit was released, World of Warcraft!

                  <p>
                    With the release in 2004 it became quite obvious that World of Warcraft was going to be a massive success.
                    Within the first year WoW had over 600,000 concurrent users on daily, this caused Blizzard to stop sales of the games
                    so more servers could be added to handle all the players. With WoW Blizzard expanded from orignally 500 employees to over 
                    4600 after the release and still growing to this day! The game has constantly evolved over the years with additional version of the 
                    game being released called expansions. Each expansion is loaded with new content keeping the game alive and making the world ever changing.
                    To date WoW has had 7 total expansions with the latest being Battle of Azeroth. At WoW's peak it had a total of over 12 million players playing!
                    The timeline starts in 2004-present with the following expansions:

                    World of Warcraft is a MMORPG which stands for Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game. The game world is massive and open giving players the freedom
                    to explore the world as they please. Being online you will interact with people from all over the world and in many cases make lifelong friends. With the game constantly
                    being updated there's really no end to the game, which means the hours spent in the game can get quite extensive and in some cases quite dangerous. Every player starts out at
                    level one and gain experience to level by many different aspects of the game including, killing creatures and questing. The game has many classes to play as fitting different playstyles,
                    these include some notable ones such as the warrior, the mage, the paladin and the rogue. These classes are quite common in fantasy themed games. Originally players could level up to 60 and start tackling
                    the harder content, nowadays the level cap has been raised all the way up to 120! Players have the options to partake in dungeons and raids, killing extremely hard bosses requiring groups of people. Raids 
                    generally have 25-10 players while dungeons have 5. There is also player vs player content where you can duel and kill other players for rewards and fun.
