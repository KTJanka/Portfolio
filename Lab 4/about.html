                    My names Kyle and I am the web designer of this page. Currently I am a student enrolled at Lorain County Community College studying
                    software development. Outside of school I work full-time for a home improvement company in the marketing department. I handle lead generating/building interest for our products and
                    customer relations for the company. After spending 4+ years in the marketing field I came to the decision that I wanted to change my career and finally start
                    exploring the field of programming/software development. I made this decision over a year ago and finally enrolled back in to school to make the dream a possibility.
                    I have always had a curiousity when it came to programming and everything that happens behind the scenes when it comes to software development. The aspect of problem solving that 
                    comes along with designing software is a huge motivator for me, it reminds me of puzzle solving and the feeling you get when you finally solve that problem is absolutely amazing.
                    With web development I taught myself a bit from home before enrolling in the web development course. One aspect I love of web design is seeing the finished product well polished and working
                    as intented. Such an amazing feeling knowing you designed the project. It is certainly not always smooth sailing when it comes to the coding aspect, but that gets my brain going trying to solve 
                    the many problems that can occur. This year I plan on meeting with Hyland Software for an interview regarding a internship for next summer. If I get accepted this will be a huge step forward for my
                    career as the retention rate is nearly 90%! I am beyond excited to see where all the knowledge I am learning will take me in the future!
