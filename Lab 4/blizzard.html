                        World of Warcraft is a game designed by Activision Blizzard, Inc. The history of Blizzard started in Febuary of 1991
                        when Allen Adham, Frank Pearce and Mike Morhaime started the company Silicon & Synapse.
                        Most of their early works included projects that were simple port games like battle chess and
                        Lord of the Rings for the Amiga. In 1992 the company release RPM racing for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System,
                        the next year they released The Lost Vikings for the SNES which became quite a fan favorite. In 1994
                        the company changed their name to Blizzard, they also began work on a new project that would be quite 
                        significant for their future! Later that year Warcraft: Orcs vs Humans was released and Blizzard officially 
                        entered the world of PC gaming. At the end of 1995 a follow-up was released called Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness beating
                        out the competition that was trying desperately to follow in their success. Warcraft 2 became an award winning game by 1996!
                        In 1996 Blizzard created the game Diablo which became a huge success with millions of fans! With the success of
                        Warcraft they also decided to try out a space theme version and Starcraft was born. Starcraft became the most successful game
                        of 1998, with over 1.8 million copies sold worldwide. In 1999 Warcraft 3 was annouced as the first roleplaying real time strategy
                        game. In 2004 Blizzard's biggest hit was released, World of Warcraft!
