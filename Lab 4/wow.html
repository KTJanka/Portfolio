                        With the release in 2004 it became quite obvious that World of Warcraft was going to be a massive success.
                        Within the first year WoW had over 600,000 concurrent users on daily, this caused Blizzard to stop sales of the games
                        so more servers could be added to handle all the players. With WoW Blizzard expanded from orignally 500 employees to over 
                        4600 after the release and still growing to this day! The game has constantly evolved over the years with additional version of the 
                        game being released called expansions. Each expansion is loaded with new content keeping the game alive and making the world ever changing.
                        To date WoW has had 7 total expansions with the latest being Battle of Azeroth. At WoW's peak it had a total of over 12 million players playing!
                        The timeline starts in 2004-present with the following expansions:
