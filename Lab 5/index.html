          When it comes to good web design the first thought for most people is the theme (Colors)
          or layout of the page. In reality even a great looking webpage can be poorly designed.
          Going in much deeper than simply fonts, colors and looks. When you are looking at good design 
          it comes down to the goal or strategy of the site. Good design gives the users clear paths to their
          desired content. If a user goes on your site and is attempting to locate your contact info/page, it should
          not take the user a long time to locate this page. This relates to the heirarchy of your website, detailing
          the path a user would use to navigate your page. If a user must go through multiple pages and links
          to locate the content they are looking for then the heirarchy may need reworked. Bad sites generally don't follow
          this user guided approach, usually displaying to much content with no real layout or goal. This can be
          extremely confusing for users as they browse the site, most of the time they are completely lost trying to find
          the right content on the page. Few ways you can fix this include finding out the layout that best translates the goal
          of the page to the user in the most efficient way possible. Making sure any ads on the site make sense for the content on
          the page and will not affect the users experience on the page.

        <!-- Good design Section -->
      <h2 id="good">The Good Web Design</h2>
        <!-- <p>Here are a couple of good examples of well designed websites:</p> -->
        <h3>AirBnB</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank"><img src="airbnb.jpg" alt="oops missing"></a></p>
        <p>
					Airbnb is a great design when it comes to simplicity and useability. A user visting this site will be able to quickly look for a destination
        	to stay using the sites immediate prombt. The nav bar also offers a help section giving the users a resource to get their questions answered quite
        	easily. The site is a great example that more is not always better and being simple sometimes is the best way to achieve the sites goal.
        </p>
        <h3>Four Rivers Smokehouse</h3>
        <p><a href="https://4rsmokehouse.com/" target="_blank"><img src="4rsmokehouse.jpg" alt="oops missing"></a></p>
        <p>
					The  first time I visited this website almost instantly my mouth started watering. They do an amazing job gettting you hungry and craving
					brisket and bbq. The layout is very easy on the eyes and fits the theme for a bbq smokehouse very well. I had no trouble looking through the site
					finding content like the menu, locations and even catering options. This makes for a well design as I spent very little time getting lost and getting off track
					trying to find the content I was looking for.

        <!-- The Bad Design Section -->
        <h2 id="bad">The Bad Web Design</h2>
        <!-- <p>Here are a couple examples of bad designed websites:</p> -->
        <h3>Ling's Cars</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank"><img src="lingscars.jpg" alt="oops missing"></a></p>
        <p>
					The amount of content on this page almost immediately gave me a headache. I was beyond lost/confused on the goal or concept of this page, this actually 
          led me to believe this was a fake site and could possibly be a scam. It is apparently a car leasing site and when you follow the links they actually seem to be legitimate.
          The site just seems to have a bit of extra flare to put it lightly. You should obviously trust the site though "Ling knows best"!
        </p>
        <h3>Rudgewick Steamshow</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.rudgwicksteamshow.co.uk/" target="_blank"><img src="rudgewick.jpg" alt="oops missing"></a></p>
        <p>
          There is a lot of dead space on this website when you first visit. This makes it hard to understand what the page is even about. If you try and 
          use the navigation bar to get around, good luck. The links on the navigation bar are misspelled, misslabeled and even copied a few times. Most of them actually make 
          very little to no sense at all. This is a very poorly designed layout and place of content.
