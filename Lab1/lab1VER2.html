              <h1> Get to Know HTML,HTML5,CSS! </h1>
                <h2>HTML</h2>
                  <p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a computer language that is the foundation of all webpages.<br>
                    It is a text based language, with only HTML most webpages are very basic lines of text.<br>
                    Hypetext is the method that you move around online using special text called hyperlinks, hyper meaning that it is linear<br>
                    or that there is no order on how you move around the web. Markup is done with HTML tags changing how text works<br>
                    (bold,italicised,etc...). Tags are what seperate simple text from HTML text. HTML has gone through man versions through<br>
                    the years:
                    <ul>
                      <li>HTML 1.0 - The first release, not many tools other than getting basic text on the web.</li>
                      <li>HTML 2.0 - Was the standard until Jan. 1997, defined many core features of HTML for the first time.</li>
                      <li>HTML 3.0 - Meant to include many new features, but browsers were to slow. 3.0 spec was eventually abandoned altogether.</li>
                      <li>HTML 3.2 - Designed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) became standard in Jan. `97.</li>
                      <li>HTML 4.01 - Large update of HTML standards and last iteration of the classic HTML. Official standard April 1998.</li>
                      <li>XHTML 1.0 - Basically it was a new set of coding rules using XML. Was joint standard with 4.01 since Jan 26, 2000.</li>
                      <li>HTML 5 - Designed for the web, not only now,  but for the future. (I will cover this in detail in the HTML5 section).</li>
                    </ul>

              <h2 id="html5info">HTML5</h2>
                <p>
                  When HTML was first implemented the amount of users on the web was drastically lower than <br>
                  todays standards. With the sudden change of technology over the years (smartphones, tablets etc...) <br>
                  many new challenges came for developers and engineers. To address these new challenges HTML5 was <br>
                  introduced to provide smoother and more consistent experiences for web designers and users alike. <br>
                  HTML5 was a collaboration between W3C and WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). <br>
                  They started working on HTML5 in 2006 to address reliance on plugins and error handling issues with <br>
                  HTML. They added more markups and greatly simplified the process of creating web applications. <br>
                  Some great features include built in video and audio capabilities, as well as the ability to store <br>
                  user data locally rather than using cookies. With the constant updating of HTML5 developers are having <br>
                  a more consistent experince when it comes to error handling of the code. <br>

              <h2 id="cssinfo">CSS</h2>
                <p>
                  As I mentioned in the HTML section with just HTML webpages are simply text based, the web would <br>
                  be quite bland and boring with just HTML webpages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) comes in to fix <br>
                  this issue by styling webpages for the user experience. CSS is able to add many features to a HTML <br>
                  document, such as background colors/pictures, resizing content on the page and change the positioning <br>
                  of the content. Every CSS file or element is a series of statements/instructions for the browser to <br>
                  display the text with different styles. Statements identify the element it needs to style and tells <br>
                  the browser how to do draw the styles. Selectors are used for identifying the HTML tag that needs <br>
                  styled. The selector chooses a tag to style with curly brackets following the tag, the style <br>
                  properties will be inside the brackets, the properties are given a value and ended with a semicolon. <br> 
                </p>
