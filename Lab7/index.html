        <img src="kingTutHistory.jpg" alt="King Tut History">
        <p>King Tutankhamen was a pharaoh of Egypt for a toal of 10 years. He sadly passed away at the very young age of
            19 about 1324 B.C. King Tut was the grandson of the great pharaoh Amenhotep II, and the son of
            Akhenaten. Akhenaten was known to be a very controversial figure in the histroy of Egypt. He changed the century 
            old belief of multiple gods in favor for the belief of a single diety. After his fathers passing, King Tut took over
            the throne as a very young of age of 9. Early on while pharoah, King Tut reversed the reform of religion that his father
            had put in place. He worked with his advisors to get Egypt back to a controlling power of the region. King Tut had a crippling disease
            from his clubbed left foot. This made him extremely frail. After extensive reseacher, it was concluded that he passed away of
            complications of maleria from a infection in his foot.</p>

        <img src="kingTutOpen.JPG" alt="King Tut Discovery">
        <p>In 1922 British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered the undisturbed tomb of King Tutankhamen. When the tomb was discovered it was a major 
            news event as most scholars at the time thought every tomb in that area had already been discovered. With as intact as the tomb was it actually
            took Carter and his team a decade to catalogue everything inside. Up until the discovery of the tomb King Tutankhamen was actually completely unknown.
            When they originally found the tomb there were some signs of robbery from grave robbers, however most items were still there! King Tuts coffin consisted of
            3 coffins in total witht the last one being made completely out of gold. After all these years the discovery of King Tut is still an extremely important landmark
            in history and archelogy.</p>
