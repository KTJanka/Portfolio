      Web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) are a list of guidelines detailing how a developer should design a website/apps. 
      When it comes to accessibility the first priority should always be that any user can access your website and have the functionality still work well.
      A great example of this would be using different font families.
      With these font families they generally include older fonts as well to be able to work on older operating systems and giviing more access to your websites.
      Some versions of CSS also will not work properly with older machines so a developer must research what css style offers the most functionality to the largest amount of users.
      Sites will also make sites more accessible for users that may have handicaps (Color blind, deaf). 
      They will add features to make the site easier to use for everyone and that is the biggest purpose!
