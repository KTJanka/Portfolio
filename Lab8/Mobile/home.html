    When it comes to mobile development being responsive is one of the main issues addressed.
    A site that is designed for a mobile device needs to be able to adjust depending on the users screen size/device. 
    If a site is not set up for a user to use mobile there can be many functionality issues.
    A website may have content overlapping and the user won't be able to use the site as intended.
    There are a few ways to make a site that works well on all devices through the same design.
    This of course would be ideal for simple designs, when it comes to larger web pages this would be way more difficult.
    Another way would be having multiple versions of the css through media queries.
    With media queries content will change based on the size of the screen.
    This is a very common way of designing mobile apps.
    The last process would be to make multiple versions of the site for each device you want.
    The site would be sent  through server side code and display the best version for the user.
