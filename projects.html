        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab1/home.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabOne.png" alt="LabOne"></a></p>
        <p>In this lab we were meant to show some very basic html and css. I enjoyed the simplicity of the porject. It made me really appreciate how simple the html generally is behind a page.</p>
        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab 2/home.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabTwo.png" alt="LabTwo"></a></p>
        <p>We were able to pick a topic and create a webpage based on it. I enjoyed getting a chance to express myself and my interest of World of Warcraft. The page gave me a chance to express some styling with css. </p>
        <h3>Project 3</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab 3/home.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabThree.png" alt="LabThree"></a></p>
        <p>Added a bit more text style. Messed around with font shadowing and text styles to give the text in the project a 3D style. Enjoyed coming back to improve the page.</p>
        <h3>Project 4</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab 4/home.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabFour.png" alt="LabFour"></a></p>
        <p>This was the final copy of the previous lab. I tried to change as much content and styles as I could. Going through colors and themes for the page took awhile, but I was happy with the final product. </p>
        <h3>Project 5</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab 5/index.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabFive.png" alt="LabFive"></a></p>
        <p>This was a very interesting and enjoyable lab when it came to finding bad examples of web design vs good design. For my design of the page I went very simplistic.</p>
        <h3>Project 6</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab6/index - Copy.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabSix.png" alt="LabSix"></a></p>
        <p>In this lab I decided to go on a topic of history and the discovery of the King Tut tomb. I then made two copies of the same page and changed the css styles for both to have two completely different pages based on style.</p>
        <h3>Project 7</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab7/index - Copy.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabSeven.png" alt="LabSeven"></a></p>
        <p>In this lab we took lab 6 and changed every aspect of the css we could. I had some issues with the sections not aligning properly, but was able to figure out a simple solution.</p>
        <h3>Project 8</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab8/Mobile/home.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabEight.png" alt="LabEight"></a></p> 
        <p>With project 8 we made two pages one for mobile development and the second regarding accessibility. The mobile page goes over the fundementals of mobile design and is responsive as well.</p>
        <h3>Project 9</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab9/index.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabNine.png" alt="LabNine"></a></p>
        <p>Lab 10 had us create a form where a user can input data for ordering a pizza. After this data was submitted the data was sent to a server link the teacher provided for us.</p>
        <h3>Project 10</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab10/index.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabTen.png" alt="LabTen"></a></p>
        <p>We had to create a table based on information the teacher provided. This table itself had to be a link to a website displaying web usage statistics. Also, included 3 seperate links to other websites.</p>
        <h3>Project 11</h3>
        <p><a href="Lab11/index.html"><img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" id="projectPics" src="LabEleven.png" alt="LabEleven"></a></p>
        <p>In Lab 11 we got the chance to use Javascript on our page. For mine I decided to make a simple lottery game. Guess a number and the Javascript will run to see if your number matches the winning number. Displaying the results after. </p>
